# My Environment Related Files

In this repository will house my various configurations. Some things are
currently still kept in a private repo elsewhere but as I get time I plan to
move all my setups to this repository. It will likely end up including:
- Dot files in my home directory
- Configurations for software that does not use dot files
- My container setup
- Others that I haven't thought of

Pull requests are allowed, but keep in mind that this is my configuration and I
reserve the right to reject a PR just because I don't like the changes :) Of
course that doesn't mean the changes are not good for other people, so ideally I
will move things in a direction that will allow easy customization for people.
